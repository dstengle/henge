A henge is a Neolithic structure consisting of an earthen bank and ditch encircling a flat area. Like the famous example of Stonehenge, henges might contain a ritual structure such as a circle of timbers or standing stones, and they could be accessed by walking along a processional avenue.

Henges were important places where people from the surrounding area gathered to share ideas and beliefs. Similarly, the Henge project provides an avenue to a central place where applications can go at runtime to receive values for properties, or to set values which can be used by other applications. In this way, Henge acts as a service for properties, and it provides a mechanism for the dynamic exchange of values--much like henges did long ago.

TIP: If you have questions about Henge, or how to integrate a dynamic properties service into your application architecture, feel free to drop us a line at support_henge@kenzan.com.
